This is a prototype first-person shooter written in C# and created in the Unity engine where the primary feature is that the player
takes control of the last enemy shot. Development is ongoing and many of the current systems need to be polished and trimmed. All 
visuals and sounds are placeholders.

This game was originally created as in a group class project. All previous working versions and changes can be viewed in the following
